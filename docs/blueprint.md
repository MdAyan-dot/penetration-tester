- Comprehensive Analysis Display: Display the results of the security analysis in a structured, easy-to-read format.

## Style Guidelines:

- Dark color scheme to reflect security focus.
- Primary color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF), a vibrant hue suggesting technology, innovation, and alertness; it aligns with the purpose of identifying vulnerabilities, with high saturation and medium brightness for balance against the dark background.
- Background color: Dark grayish-blue (#293462), offering contrast to the electric blue and softening the overall scheme for extended readability.
- Accent color: Lime green (#A7D1AB), a color close to the primary, suggesting security, action, and direct communication of positive results; lighter and brighter than the background for callouts and notifications.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' for headlines, a modern, digitized look appropriate for technology, and 'Inter' for body text to improve readability.
- Use security-themed icons for each module and report type.
- Clean and structured layout for easy navigation and module selection.
